# Getting Started

* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/steamboat-dev/steamb0at.git`: **RECURSIVE IS NEEDED** as we use submodules.
* `npm i`
* :tada:

# Updating 

Since we use submodules, it's a good idea to update those when pulling, too. To update, run `git submodule update --recursive --remote`
